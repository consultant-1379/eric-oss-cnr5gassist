## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[ADP Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to

## Development Environment prerequisites

The development framework for {% Project Name %} is based on [bob][bob]. To be
able to run bob, the following tools need to exist on the host:

- python3
- bash
- docker

Bob expects you to have a valid docker login towards your docker registry on the
host, currently it can't handle automatic login by itself. If you are using
armdocker, then you can login with the following command:

```text
docker login armdocker.rnd.ericsson.se
```

## How can I use this repository?

This repository contains the source code of {% Project Name %} service including
functional and test code, documentation and configuration files for manual and
automatic build and verification.

If you want to fix a bug or just want to experiment with adding a feature,
you'll want to try the service in your environment using a local copy of the
project's source.

You can start cloning the GIT repository to get your local copy:

```text
git clone ssh://<userid>@gerrit.ericsson.se:29418/<project-path>
```

Once you have your local copy, you shall navigate the root directory and
update the submodules needed to build the project:

```text
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You can now build the service with the following command, from the root
directory:

```text
./bob/bob build image package
```

You can verify your build running the tests located in the folder `test`
using the following command:

```text
./bob/bob test
```

If you are satisfied with your change and want to submit for review,
create a new git commit and then push it with the following:

```text
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
```

> **Note:** Please follow the
[guidelines for contributors](#Submitting-Contributions)
before you push your change for review.

### Submitting Contributions

This section guides you through submitting your own contribution, including bug
fixing, new features or any kind of improvement on the content of this
repository. The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for project's maintainers to review contributions

#### Before Submitting A Contribution

- **Engage the project maintainers** in the proper way so that they are prepared
  to receive your contribution and can provide valuable suggestion on the design
  choices. Follow the guidelines to [report a bug](#Reporting-Bugs) or to
  [propose an enhancement](#Suggesting-Features).

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Contribution?

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the
maintainers:

- **Follow the [styleguides](#Styleguides)** when implementing your change.
- **Provide a proper description of the change and the reason for it**,
referring to the associated JIRA issue if it exists.
- **Provide proper automatic tests to verify your change**, extending the
existing test suites or creating new ones in case of new features.
- **Update the project documentation if needed**. In case of new features,
they shall be properly described in the the relevant documentation.
- After you submit your contribution, **verify that the automatic
[CI pipeline][pipeline] for your change is passing**.
If the CI pipeline is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to
your change, please leave a comment on the change request explaining why you
believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the pipeline for you.
If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue
to track that problem.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull
request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design
work, tests, or other changes before your change request can be ultimately
accepted.
